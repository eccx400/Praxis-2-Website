							<p>Looking at Twitter’s interface made it very obvious that the design itself is focused towards keeping the user’s attention for as long as possible in addition to promoting interaction and responses by the users to the posts. In her article, Sano-Franchini notes that Loranger (2014) describes Facebook as “long, endless pages are good for time-killing activities because users are in the mindset for serendipitous exploration and discovery”(Sano-Franchini, 16). I believe that Twitter does this job even better than Facebook, due to its cleaner design interface that focuses more on getting users scroll down the newsfeed in search for more information. It taps into the nature that humans want to know the unknown, and that they want to stay connected to the most current and important news, which cannot be provided by generic news media due to the requirements of a time buffer to edit and publish their articles. She also notes that “the news feed presents an anachronistic time and order”(16). These traits are especially true for political content. </p>
							<p>From my study looking at the impeachment hearings, I was able to use the hashtag function to find various news media and even personalized opinions about the topic at a very short time. Events happening across the country or even around the world seem to be happening at the palm of my hands, which can lead to better awareness as well as understanding various opinions. Sano-Franchini noted from her experiences that “the consequences of Facebook bringing exposure to such events front and center in my everyday life, and I found myself consciously aware of how social media affected how I interpreted events, issues, the world, and myself while I was out and about offline as well (14). As mentioned earlier in the results section, my idea of Twitter as a tool for political reporting is that it does its job even better than Facebook as it allows for any generic user to become a news reporter. With a good “hot take” or “soundbite”, a post can rapidly gain popularity by getting enough likes and retweets, and that they may have enough significance as an article published by a mainstream media outlet.</p>
							<p>Some of the limitations that I ran into when conducting the study were that in regards to the news on the impeachment hearings, they were so recent that I was not able to find decently long threads as a wholescale discussion about the pros and cons of the impeachment. In my mind, I was going to do an analysis of an online debate between presumably a liberal and a conservative discussing the necessities of impeachment to study of Twitter as a medium for forum discussions.</p>
