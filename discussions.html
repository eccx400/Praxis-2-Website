							<p>Looking at Twitter’s interface made it very obvious that the design itself is dedicated towards regular users of social media or someone who is seeking a way to better connect with the world around them. In addition, the design of the interface itself is focused towards <mark>keeping the user’s attention for as long as possible</mark> in addition to <mark>promoting interaction and responses</mark> by the users to the posts. In her article, Sano-Franchini notes that Loranger (2014) describes Facebook as “long, endless pages are good for time-killing activities because users are in the mindset for serendipitous exploration and discovery”(Sano-Franchini, 16). I believe that Twitter does this job even better than Facebook, due to its <mark>cleaner design interface</mark> that focuses more on getting users scroll down the newsfeed in search for more information. It taps into the nature that <mark>humans want to know the unknown</mark>, and that they want to stay connected to the most current and important news, which cannot be provided by generic news media due to the requirements of a time buffer to edit and publish their articles. She also notes that “the news feed presents an anachronistic time and order”(16). These traits are especially true for political content. </p>
							<p>From my study looking at the impeachment hearings, I was able to use the hashtag function to find various news media and even personalized opinions about the topic at a very short time. Events happening across the country or even around the world seem to be happening at the palm of my hands, which can lead to better awareness as well as understanding various opinions. Sano-Franchini noted from her experiences that “the consequences of Facebook bringing exposure to such events front and center in my everyday life, and I found myself consciously aware of how social media affected how I interpreted events, issues, the world, and myself while I was out and about offline as well (14). As mentioned earlier in the results section, my idea of Twitter as a tool for political reporting is that it does its job even better than Facebook as it <mark>allows for any generic user to become a news reporter</mark>. With a good “hot take” or “soundbite”, a post can <mark>rapidly gain popularity by getting enough likes and retweets</mark>, and that they may have enough significance as an article published by a mainstream media outlet.</p>
							<p>
								Compared with Sano-Franchini's study, my study was different because I could better utilize <mark>Twitter's mature hashtag function</mark> in order to search for the lastest and most important news. Since Twitter itself as
								and interface is more "public" than that of Facebook, I was able to immediately utilize the hashtag to find the most recent and substantial information on #ImpeachmentHearings. Although Sano-Franchini did mention 
								the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, she did not mention dirrectly searching for it, but instead used Facebook's mainpage newsfeed in order to search for similar content. In fact, the #BlackLivesMatter tweet probably
								had a larger impact in its substance, importance, and proliferation on Twitter than it did on Facebook, just because of its more mature hashtag algorithm and interface.
							</p>
							<p>Some of the limitations that I ran into when conducting the study were that in regards to the news on the impeachment hearings, they were so recent that I was not able to find decently long threads as a wholescale discussion about the pros and cons of the impeachment. In my mind, I was going to do an analysis of an online debate between presumably a liberal and a conservative discussing the necessities of impeachment to study of Twitter as a medium for forum discussions.
							   Although I did find a comment thread with conservative and liberal users discussing their differences in opinion on the original tweet, I did not find a very complex debate like the twitter thread presented in class. The reason why I was not able to find a meaningful debate on the impeachment issue is due to the recency and confusion of the issue; usually with regards
							   to regular social issues such as the #BlackLivesMatter campaign, the problem is very clear and visible to the public, and there is a lot of room to debate because both sides are very aware of the socio-political issue. Comparatively, the impeachment hearings are harder
							   to judge because most of what is happening is rather unknown to the general public, and there isn't very specific evidence that would completely "outrage" general citizens into pushing for an impeachment. Thus, so far, the issue is mainly limited to those who are interested
							   in the ongoing debate; however, without the full details, it is hard for there to be a comprehensive argument even on Twitter.
