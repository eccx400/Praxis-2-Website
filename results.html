							<h2>Browsing</h2>
							<p>Any user who uses Twitter knows that they must start their browsing experience on the Twitter homepage, which provides a platform for them to post content, and catch up on the most current news and posts relevant to them. The homepage is also a place for companies to put advertisements on Twitter, which is an important aspect of Twitter’s business and an important part of the user experience for generic Twitter users. </p>

							<h2>Reacting</h2>
							<p>In comparison with Facebook, Twitter provides much less functions for reacting to specific posts or replies, which significantly limits this part of its applications. Sano-Franchini describes that Facebook allows “six emotions reactions: Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry, as represented by six animated emoji” (19) compared to Twitter’s single “heart” option. With an abundance of emoji reactions, users on Facebook can more likely select the option that matches their emotional viewpoint on the post, while the same action on Twitter is severely limited by the dearth of options.</p>

							<h2>Commenting</h2>
							<p>Commenting on Twitter posts is similar to that of Facebook in that users can directly interact with the post and its replies by clicking in the text box that is provided and writing down whatever they are thinking. However, unlike Facebook, Twitter has limitations to the size of the comment; in the past, the limit of the number of characters on a single tweet is 140 characters. Twitter has changed it so that the maximum number of characters now is at 280 characters, which may seem like a lot, but is actually restraining when it comes to users trying to express their complete emotions. Thus, a lot of users resort to quick “soundbites” and utilize images and gifs to express their immediate reaction to a post.</p>
							<h2>Posting</h2>
							<p>Posting on Twitter is similar to that of Facebook, with a variety of options available to the user. At the top of the front page is a text box in which one can write their “tweet” and post it. The tweet can be embedded with text, images, polls, and gifs as seen below. The different buttons allows users to express their ideas and their opinions in various forms.</p>
