							<p>In the era of the world wide web, people across the world can stay connected to each other through social media. And when speaking of social media, one cannot deny the influence of Twitter as a medium for virtual communication. Almost everyone, from politicians to celebrities to the average citizens around the world communicate using Twitter in order to maintain relevancy and connect. With its enormous online population, Twitter has also become the standard for news platforms and digital advertising, replacing the television that was so popular the generation before.</p>
							<p>I personally have been using Twitter on and off for at least 6 years. My current Twitter account was actually created as part of a social survey inquiry during one of my summer internships in high school, and was actually a joint account between me and two other friends; however, after they left for college and stopped using it, I acquired the account and started using it for my personal enjoyment.</p>
							<p>For this Praxis 2 assignment, I will be looking at the article “Designing Outrage, Programming Discord: A Critical Interface Analysis of Facebook as a Campaign Technology” by Jennifer Sano-Franchini as inspiration and the source for my replication study. While Sano-Franchini looked at the importance of Facebook as a source for political campaigning and communication, I will be looking at Twitter as an alternative source, and identifying their notable differences. I especially will be focusing the user interface on Twitter and how much of an impact it has on user experience and determining user content in a way that might affect how they interact with the Twitter ecosystem.</p>
